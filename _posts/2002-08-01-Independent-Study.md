### Day by Day Outward Bound Course

<div class="newspaper">
	<p>At first, no one bonded. We were all loners. Our two instructors were very open and easy to talk to, but that is how they are supposed to be.</p><br>
	<p>It took a few days for people to begin to connect. Day 2 was what I consider a learning day. We were learning each other’s names, and what kind of people we were. There was a little conversation, the same questions over and over, “Where do you live?”, “How old are you?” , “What year are you in school?”. Just to begin to know each other. After a couple of hours, there was more to the conversations than that. Although, it still was very simple.</p><br>
	<p>Day three we became comfortable with each other, we all knew most people’s names, and had substantial conversations. Relationships began to flourish, and conversations erupted. We were in the learning stage of the course and were forced to work closely together. Being on a strenuous course gave us all something to relate. Day three was what I consider the day that most relationships started, only a few were to come.</p>
