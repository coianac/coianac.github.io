### Day by Day Outward Bound Course

<div class="newspaper">
	<p>At first, no one bonded. We were all loners. Our two instructors were very open and easy to talk to, but that is how they are supposed to be.</p>
	<p>It took a few days for people to begin to connect. Day 2 was what I consider a learning day. We were learning each other’s names, and what kind of people we were. There was a little conversation, the same questions over and over, “Where do you live?”, “How old are you?” , “What year are you in school?”. Just to begin to know each other. After a couple of hours, there was more to the conversations than that. Although, it still was very simple.</p>
	<p>Day three we became comfortable with each other, we all knew most people’s names, and had substantial conversations. Relationships began to flourish, and conversations erupted. We were in the learning stage of the course and were forced to work closely together. Being on a strenuous course gave us all something to relate. Day three was what I consider the day that most relationships started, only a few were to come.</p>
	<p>On day four we went to a difficult climbing area. This forced the group to cooperate and trust each other. Three full days into the course, we had little trust in each other. For some this might have been difficult, but it did not affect me, I did not think twice. During this activity, Justin began to talk, and become friendlier. Most of the group was tight, there were only a few people that kept their distance, or did not fit in as well. Although Daryl seemed quiet and to himself, you could tell that he was just waiting to come out. He would talk a little here and there, but not a substantial amount. </p>
	<p>Day five was our first peak climb, which was also the largest bonding experience the whole trip. Not only did it mean that we were at the top of the world, 9,000 feet, high, but we accomplished an amazing feat as a team. We did something extremely difficult together. At the very top, the highest point, we opened our high low pack, which kept us at our highest of highs and got us out of our lowest lows. In the pack were Twix bars, a nice treat from the usual boring tasteless food. I was chosen to open the pack, maybe I was seen as some sort of leader. I had navigated the group to the top and kept us going, I also tried to make friends with everyone, I guess I am some sort of leader, but not the leader.</p>
	<p>Day six we hiked seven miles on a ridge and then traversed down to a very rainy, buggy campsite. During this, Justin kept becoming closer to people. He and I began to talk and I learned that he was a very funny kid. There are not and definite roles between anyone, everyone makes jokes, and most kids motivate, and there are no real leaders.</p>
	<p>Day seven we hiked to an untouched campsite. We were the first ones to ever camp there. I began to think about growing closer to Daryl. I knew that we had to spend six or seven hours together in the airport, and I did not want that to be annoying. The next day was our solos, So I waited until after then to make an impact on Daryl.</p>
	<p>Day eight we waited all day until we could go to our solo sights. All day the entire group just talked, that is all we could do. We grew tight. Daryl also became more open and bonded with the group. We all played some games out instructors told us about, and after dinner was time for solos. We were to be silent until we were brought back. The silence began and ended with a quote. 
Solitude is a silent storm that breaks down all our dead branches.</p>
