### Goal
To understand how consumers perceive image quality with the intentions of delivering higher quality images (better color representation, less pixelation) while maintaining a cost sensitive image file size.

### Hypothesis
By increasing image size by 1.5x and decreasing JPG quality of an image to 40%, when a browser downscales and interpolates a JPG, the imagem will render at an indistinguishable quality when compared to a higher quality JPG at it's required in-browser size. 

**Benefit** This will results in an approximate 30% decrease in image size and therfore page load speeds will decrease.
