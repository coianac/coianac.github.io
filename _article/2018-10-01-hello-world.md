This year has been a really good one. I set some very strong intentions at the onset of 2018 and have been driving hard into their completion. Or at-the-least, to see what I can make of them. Because we cannot always define success as attaining the exact goal one has defined, but sometimes have to be understanding that failure is a possible outcome from which we will learn and grow just as well. And from that failure, maybe take a second go at it -- with reflection comes wisdom and an alternate approach. 

My hope here, is to learn more intimitaley the workings of gitHub to further empower my understanding and conversations with my engineering teams. And in doing so, I am structuring a space for my thoughts and my portfolio of work, which may or many not take on a mashed up form. That is yet to be defined. 

So, please bare with me as I dable and explore this world. 

Thank you for your time. 
Nicolas Coia
