Howdy, and welcome. I've been defining digital strategies and experiences for the suite of URBN e-commerce sites for over 5 years, and I love the work I get to do and the people with whom I am able to spend my days.

### Setup

Monochrome may be installed by simply downloading the .zip folder from the [repository on Github](https://github.com/thereviewindex/monochrome/archive/master.zip).

After extracting the content from the folder into the selected directory, you can type ``jekyll serve`` from the terminal, than open your browser to ``0.0.0.0:4000/monochrome/`` and you will find it there.

Additionally it is possible to fork the repository and use Github Pages as hosting. By following this way it will be enough to change the ``baseurl`` value into the ``_config.yml`` file, with the directory name of your project (for example /blog) or simply with a "/" (slash) if you want install Monochrome in the root.
