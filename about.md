# Hi, I'm Nicolas ðŸ‘‹
Currently, Iâ€™m a lead designer and mentor for the suite of e-commerce sites under the URBN umbrella. I specialize in personalization, listing, and the users journey from inspiration to purchase. During my time with URBN, I designed and launched the companies first fully responsive website, WithoutWalls â€” it is currently a defunct business, but we still use a lot of the design principles that I laid a foundation for.

If youâ€™re interested in heuristics, see my post on the heuristic evaluation tool I put together while I entered with Think Company â€” Weâ€™ve been using it at URBN to qualify our experiences. Additionally, Iâ€™ve presented a light weight intro to heuristic evalâ€™s to students at Temple Universitys Management Information Science programâ€™s User Experience Course.
