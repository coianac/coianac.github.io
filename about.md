## About
Howdy, and welcome. I've been defining digital strategies and experiences for the suite of URBN e-commerce sites for over 5 years. I love the work I get to be a part of and the people with whom I am able to spend my days. Together we craft stories; we observe how users interact; we help design a useful and exciting internet shopping experience. 

If you haven't, check out our sites and let me know where you find friction:

* [Urban Outfitters](https://www.urbanoutfitters.com)
* [Anthropologie](https://www.anthropologie.com)
* [Free People](https://www.freepeople.com)
