<h2>image quality & purchase intent</h2>
<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>To understand how consumers perceive image quality with the intentions of delivering higher quality images (better color representation, less pixilation) while maintaining a cost sensitive image file size.</p>
<h4>Hypothesis</h4>
<p>Increasing an image by 1.5x times its in-browser requirement and decreasing its JPG quality to 40% will render an image that is of indistinguishable quality when compared to a 1x, 100% JPG quality image.</p>
<blockquote><b>Benefit</b> This should result in an approximate 30% decrease in image size and an improved page-load speed!</blockquote>
