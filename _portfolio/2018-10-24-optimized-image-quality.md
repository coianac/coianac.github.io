<h2>image quality & purchase intent</h2>
<h3>goal</h3>
<p>To understand how consumers perceive image quality with the intentions of delivering higher quality images (better color representation, less pixilation) while maintaining a cost sensitive image file size.</p>

<h4>Hypothesis</h4>
<p>Increasing an image by 1.5x times its in-browser requirement and decreasing its JPG quality to 40% will render an image that is of indistinguishable quality when compared to a 1x, 100% JPG quality image.</p>
<blockquote><b>Benefit</b> This should result in an approximate 30% decrease in image size and an improved page-load speed!</blockquote>

<h4>Category Page & Image Zoom Views</h4>
<p>We put together sumulated views of a category page and image zoom for participants to select which image they felt was of the best quality.</p>
<p>The views included pagination between selections as well as a "Thank you for completion" screen which displayed live results of the study.</p>

<h3>results</h3>
<p>Feel free to download the analysis of our collected data if you're interested in the details. <a href="coianac.github.io/img/Study Results_1.1.pdf">Study Results PDF</a>.</p>
<p>In short > the results came out inconclusive. Participants could not discern a visual disparity between the 3 image presets. We concluded this as a success. After a close inspection of the images and the results, we were able to move forward with delivering a 1.5x, 40% JPG quality image preset.</p>

<h4>Delivery Strategy</h4>
<p>As a customer progresses deeper into their journey, provide larger and higher quality images. Higher quality images at appropriate touchpoints empower shoppes during the carting and purchasing decision making process.</p>
