### Business Opportunity
Creating a frictionless method of product collection built on a social graph database can increase business insights into customer modeling and act as a point of leverage for customer profiling. Providing recommendations on: 
  + user interest
  + user intent
  + user purchase behaviour

Understanding customer inspiration and purchase intent can enable the business to: 
1. Send trigger emails based on inventory or sales of saved items.
2. Provide recommendations contextual to the shoppers journey. 
3. Reminder shoppers of saved items that are low inventory, on sale, or complimentary to their current cart
4. Create lists dynamically based on most collected items

### Customer Opportunity
  + Collect products without limits
    ** Where limit = the requirement of creating a SKU prior to adding an item to list (the classic wish list model)
  + Explore shopping / inspiration lists of their peers
  + Collect goods from Instagram via a branded hashtag. Example: 
    ++ #UOList, ANList, FPList
    ++ #UOLove, ANLove, FPLove
